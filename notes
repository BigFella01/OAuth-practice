AUTH 2.0 explained: 

The user grants our application access to their information. Our application
then communicates with Google or Githubs authorization server to let them know
we have been granted access. The authorization server then provides our app with
an access token. Our app then sends this access token to Google or Github's 
resource server and retrieves what it needs.
